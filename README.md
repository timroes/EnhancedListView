EnhancedListView
================

An Android ListView with enhanced functionality (e.g. Swipe To Dismiss and Undo)

The documentation can be found in the wiki: https://github.com/timroes/EnhancedListView/wiki

Update Notice
-------------

**v0.3.0** All resources (layouts, colors, etc.) got an `elv_` prefix. So if you have changed 
	some of these in your own app, you must make sure to also add the `elv_` prefix to your
	resources (e.g. to change or internationalize the "Undo" string, you will need to have a
	string resource `elv_undo` instead of `undo`).
